# twitter-scrapper

Here scrapping of Twitter is done using bs4
where a user name is entered and the following information of a user is displayed below

1: biography
2: Followers_count
3: following_count
4: likes_count
5: user_id

I have used a free website for getting proxy id, the website is "https://free-proxy-list.net/"
for paid proxy, u can use oxylab which can generate you a proxy id which can be used by any time.

## Now when the proxy is not available in free website the it will show this output
